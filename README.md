- R (independent validation of statistical results)

## Files
- AB_Test_Analysis.xlsx : Excel workbook containing raw data, analysis, formulas, and charts
- ab_test_validation.R : R script used to validate Excel results
- A_B_Test_Summary_Report.pdf : One-page summary report with conclusions and next steps

## Key Result
Variant B shows a statistically significant improvement in conversion rate compared to Variant A (p < 0.05).

## Notes
The dataset used in this project is simulated for demonstration purposes.
